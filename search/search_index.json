This is the start of my AI Safety journey!</p> <p>I learned about AI Safety from the Seattle Llama4 Hackathon on June 21st, 2025 where I learned of AI 2027. After finishing an awesome summer of engineering, I realized the problems which excite me the most lie at the crossroads of engineering and science (computation and linguistics). </p> <p>The urgent need for understanding increasingly capable AI models coupled with a burning passion for working at the interdisciplinary intersection of NLP, linguistics, and engineering at scale has sharpened my goal: to become an AI Safety researcher in Mechanistic Interpretability.</p>"},{"location":"#working-backwards","title":"Working Backwards","text":"<p>Sometimes (often) I get analysis paralysis or want to wait for the perfect {time, situation, background, preparation} to start which makes it difficult to get into pursuing my goals (and dreams).
